# DALI

This directory contains my projects for the 2025 DALI application.

##  The DALI Data Challenge

The file `data_challenge.ipynb` is a Jupyter notebook file containing my OpenCV implementation of the data challenge. Using OpenCV, I prototyped a solution to approximately count the number of barnacles within a square-shaped wire frame. This count (obtained by randomly sampling multiple areas) can be used to extrapolate the actual count of barnacles in coastal tide pools. 

In addition, the following image files are included to verify the successful run of my OpenCV code.
